# Minimal configuration for extensionless URLs.
    # EasyPanel handles the server, root, and PHP-FPM setup.
    
    # This directive implements your core logic:
    # 1. Try the requested URI as a file ($uri)
    # 2. Try the requested URI as a directory ($uri/)
    # 3. If neither works, internally redirect to search for $uri.php
    # 4. If PHP search fails, internally redirect to search for $uri.html
    # (Note: EasyPanel's default configuration will handle the actual .php and .html resolution)
