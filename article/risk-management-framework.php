     <h2>1. Purpose & Objectives</h2>

    <h3>1.1 Purpose</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this Risk Management Framework is to define a structured, transparent, and proactive approach to identifying, assessing, mitigating, monitoring, and reporting risks that may impact the operations, assets, clients, and reputation of Penthian Ltd, a licensed Virtual Asset Marketplace (Class S) under the Financial Services Commission (FSC) of Mauritius.</p>
    <p>This framework ensures that risk management is embedded across all layers of the organization — from strategic decisions to operational processes — and that it remains aligned with our legal obligations, technological infrastructure, and ethical values.</p>

    <h3>1.2 Key Objectives</h3>
    <p>The key objectives of this Risk Management Framework are to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ensure Compliance:</strong> Meet all FSC regulatory expectations under the Virtual Asset and Initial Token Offering Services (VAITOS) Act, AML/CFT laws, and applicable data protection regulations.</li>
        <li><strong>Protect Stakeholders:</strong> Safeguard the interests of investors, asset issuers, token holders, partners, and the broader ecosystem by anticipating and mitigating risks before they escalate.</li>
        <li><strong>Embed Governance:</strong> Integrate risk management into Penthian’s corporate governance structure, with clear roles and responsibilities assigned to leadership, compliance, operations, and technology teams.</li>
        <li><strong>Support Innovation Securely:</strong> Enable innovation in asset tokenization and blockchain technology while managing associated cyber, legal, financial, and operational risks.</li>
        <li><strong>Build Trust & Reputation:</strong> Foster trust in Penthian as a responsible, resilient, and principled marketplace guided by transparency, integrity, and the fruits of the Spirit (love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control).</li>
        <li><strong>Promote Resilience:</strong> Ensure business continuity and the ability to adapt quickly in the face of disruption, market volatility, security incidents, or regulatory change.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.3 Scope of Application</h3>
    <p>This framework applies to all:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Penthian Ltd operations, systems, and business activities globally</li>
        <li>Staff, consultants, and third-party vendors</li>
        <li>Tokenization and trading of real estate, SME shares, or other digital assets</li>
        <li>Interactions with smart contracts, wallets, investor dashboards, APIs, and on-chain protocols</li>
        <li>Strategic decisions related to new product launches, geographic expansion, or partnerships</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.4 Alignment With Core Values</h3>
    <p>Penthian believes effective risk management must be grounded in our core belief system. We operate not only to maximize investor returns, but also to uphold ethical stewardship, responsible leadership, and community empowerment.</p>
    <p>Our decisions — including those related to risk — are guided by biblical virtues and kingdom-minded leadership. This foundation enhances our risk culture by ensuring that the pursuit of growth is never separated from the principles of wisdom, accountability, and love for others.</p>

    <h2>2. Risk Governance Structure</h2>
    <p>Effective risk management requires clear leadership, defined responsibilities, and a culture of ownership at every level of the organization. This section outlines the governance structure Penthian Ltd uses to oversee and manage risk across all business and technology functions.</p>

    </ul>

    <h2>3. Risk Identification & Classification</h2>
    <p>Proactive risk identification is the foundation of effective risk management. At Penthian, we classify and monitor risks across all dimensions of the business — financial, operational, legal, technological, and reputational — to ensure nothing is overlooked as we scale our tokenization marketplace globally.</p>

    <h3>3.1 Risk Identification Methods</h3>
    <p>Risks are identified through multiple channels:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Internal workshops and staff self-assessments</li>
        <li>Incident and complaint analysis</li>
        <li>Compliance reviews and regulatory updates</li>
        <li>Audit findings (internal and external)</li>
        <li>Smart contract code reviews and testnet deployments</li>
        <li>Real-time monitoring dashboards (KYC, wallet behavior, on-chain activity)</li>
        <li>Market intelligence (e.g., changes in crypto regulation or blockchain exploits)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Identified risks are recorded in the central Risk Register, with details on origin, impact, and likelihood.</p>

    <h3>3.2 Risk Categories</h3>
    <p>Penthian classifies risks under the following major categories:</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Category</th>
            <th>Description</th>
            <th>Examples</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Operational</td>
            <td>Failures in internal processes, systems, or people</td>
            <td>Transaction delays, payout errors, staff misconduct</td>
        </tr>

            <td>Market volatility, liquidity crunch, token price drops</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Strategic</td>
            <td>Poor business decisions or misaligned growth strategies</td>
            <td>Entering high-risk jurisdictions, overexposure to one asset class</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Reputation</td>
            <td>Loss of investor trust or media scrutiny</td>

            <td>COVID-19 impact on operations, war in key market</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h3>3.3 Blockchain-Specific Risks</h3>
    <p>As a blockchain-based platform, Penthian pays special attention to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Smart Contract Vulnerabilities:</strong> Bugs, logic errors, upgradability flaws</li>
        <li><strong>Chain Dependency Risk:</strong> Downtime or forks in chains (e.g., Ethereum, Polygon)</li>
        <li><strong>Gas Fee Volatility:</strong> Impact on transaction throughput or user costs</li>
        <li><strong>Token Standard Risks:</strong> Misuse of ERC-3643 permissions, misuse of tokenized identity</li>
        <li><strong>Oracles & Bridges:</strong> Compromise of data feeds or cross-chain mechanisms</li>
        <li><strong>Custodial/Non-Custodial Wallet Risks:</strong> Lost keys, incorrect routing, phishing</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These are tracked separately in a Blockchain Risk Register maintained by the CTO.</p>

    <h3>3.4 Emerging Risks</h3>
    <p>Penthian actively monitors and classifies “early signal” risks such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Changes in global tokenization regulation (e.g., MiCA, VARA, SEC updates)</li>
        <li>New attack vectors (e.g., LLM-enhanced phishing, AI-based exploits)</li>
        <li>Regulatory perception of DeFi/tokenized securities</li>
        <li>Shifts in investor sentiment toward digital ownership</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Emerging risks are assessed quarterly and presented to the Board via the Risk Committee.</p>

    <h2>4. Risk Assessment & Scoring Methodology</h2>
    <p>Once risks are identified, Penthian uses a structured assessment process to evaluate their potential impact and likelihood. This helps prioritize mitigation efforts and allocate resources effectively across the business.</p>

    <h3>4.1 Risk Assessment Model</h3>
    <p>Penthian employs a qualitative risk matrix model, assessing each risk based on:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Likelihood (Probability):</strong> How likely is the risk to occur?</li>
        <li><strong>Impact (Severity):</strong> What would be the consequence if the risk materializes?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each is scored on a scale of 1 to 5:</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Score</th>
            <th>Likelihood</th>
            <th>Impact</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>Rare</td>
            <td>Insignificant (e.g., no disruption)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>Unlikely</td>
            <td>Minor (e.g., short outage, minor complaint)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>3</td>
            <td>Possible</td>
            <td>Moderate (e.g., financial loss < $10k, reputational impact)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>4</td>
            <td>Likely</td>
            <td>Major (e.g., regulatory breach, service downtime)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>5</td>
            <td>Almost Certain</td>
            <td>Severe (e.g., platform shutdown, legal action)</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h3>4.2 Risk Rating Matrix</h3>
    <p>Combining likelihood and impact produces a Risk Score:</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Likelihood → / Impact ↓</th>
            <th>1</th>
            <th>2</th>
            <th>3</th>
            <th>4</th>
            <th>5</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>1 – Rare</td>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>3</td>
            <td>4</td>
            <td>5</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2 – Unlikely</td>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>4</td>
            <td>6</td>
            <td>8</td>
            <td>10</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>3 – Possible</td>
            <td>3</td>
            <td>6</td>
            <td>9</td>
            <td>12</td>
            <td>15</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>4 – Likely</td>
            <td>4</td>
            <td>8</td>
            <td>12</td>
            <td>16</td>
            <td>20</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>5 – Almost Certain</td>
            <td>5</td>
            <td>10</td>
            <td>15</td>
            <td>20</td>
            <td>25</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>Each risk is classified as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Low Risk (1–5):</strong> Monitor under business-as-usual</li>
        <li><strong>Medium Risk (6–12):</strong> Requires control measures and periodic review</li>
        <li><strong>High Risk (13–19):</strong> Must be mitigated actively with leadership oversight</li>
        <li><strong>Critical Risk (20–25):</strong> Escalate immediately, involve CEO and Board, implement urgent action plan</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4.3 Risk Heat Map</h3>
    <p>Penthian’s Compliance Officer produces a quarterly heat map summarizing all active risks, colored by risk level. This map is reviewed by the Risk & Compliance Committee and used to drive risk-based decision-making across:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Token listings</li>
        <li>Geographic expansion</li>
        <li>Tech rollouts (e.g., wallet upgrades, bridge integrations)</li>
        <li>Partnerships and vendor selection</li>
        <li>Secondary market operations</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4.4 Risk Appetite Statement</h3>
    <p>Penthian’s Board has set the following risk appetite thresholds:</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Category</th>
            <th>Appetite</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Compliance & Legal</td>
            <td>Zero Tolerance for regulatory breach, AML violations, or non-disclosure</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Cybersecurity</td>
            <td>Low: High standards for secure-by-design architecture</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Operational</td>
            <td>Medium: Acceptable within defined SLAs</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Market Volatility</td>
            <td>Medium–High: Due to nature of tokenized assets</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Innovation Risk</td>
            <td>Medium: Encouraged, but must be tested in sandbox before launch</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Reputational</td>
            <td>Low: Brand trust and investor confidence is critical</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>These appetite levels are re-evaluated annually and included in all major risk discussions.</p>

    <h2>5. Risk Mitigation & Control Measures</h2>
