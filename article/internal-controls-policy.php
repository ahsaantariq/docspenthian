     <h2>1. Introduction & Objective</h2>
    <p>This Internal Controls Policy outlines the key principles, structures, and procedures that govern how Penthian Ltd manages its business operations, regulatory obligations, and risk exposures in line with the Financial Services Commission (FSC) requirements under the Virtual Asset and Initial Token Offering Services Act 2021 (VAITOS) and the Financial Intelligence and Anti-Money Laundering Act (FIAMLA).</p>
    <p>As a licensed Virtual Asset Marketplace (Class S) Operator, Penthian’s mission is to provide a secure, transparent, and compliant platform for tokenizing real-world assets, with a specific focus on real estate and small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs). Our internal controls are designed to support this mission by ensuring that the company:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Operates with integrity, accountability, and discipline</li>
        <li>Implements effective segregation of duties and risk mitigation</li>
        <li>Maintains clear lines of reporting and responsibility across departments</li>
        <li>Minimizes the risk of fraud, operational failures, or regulatory breaches</li>
        <li>Upholds its fiduciary and ethical obligations to clients, investors, and regulators</li>
        <li>Safeguards client assets and personal data</li>
        <li>Detects and responds quickly to anomalies, threats, or compliance issues</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This policy is aligned with Penthian’s values and founding principles — including our commitment to transparency, investor protection, technological trust, and the fruits of the Spirit (love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control). These values are embedded in our leadership, compliance, and smart contract protocols.</p>
    <p>All employees, officers, directors, and contractors must read, understand, and comply with this Internal Controls Policy. It is reviewed regularly and approved by the Board of Directors.</p>

    <h2>2. Scope & Applicability</h2>
    <p>This Internal Controls Policy applies to all business units, departments, and personnel within Penthian Ltd, including directors, senior executives, employees, contractors, agents, and technology service providers involved in the operation of the Penthian platform.</p>
    <p>It covers the full lifecycle of our platform’s operations and activities, including but not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Client onboarding and KYC/AML processes</li>
        <li>Tokenization of real-world assets (RWA)</li>
        <li>Listing and trading on the Penthian primary and secondary marketplaces</li>
        <li>Asset and investor management, including revenue distribution</li>
        <li>Use of smart contracts, wallets, and ERC-3643 token permissioning</li>
        <li>Risk scoring, monitoring, and alert handling</li>
        <li>Governance of service providers, vendors, and outsourced technology partners</li>
        <li>Financial and treasury operations</li>
        <li>Recordkeeping and reporting to regulators (FSC, FIU)</li>
        <li>Compliance with data protection laws and cross-border restrictions</li>
        <li>Internal and external audits, reviews, and investigations</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This policy also extends to automated systems and smart contract protocols, which are considered functionally equivalent to internal teams when enforcing platform rules and compliance logic. Where technology is used to perform functions typically assigned to humans (e.g., transaction validation, KYC checks, wallet restrictions), those functions fall under the same internal control framework.</p>
    <p>The policy is mandatory for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>All current employees and management of Penthian Ltd</li>
        <li>All third-party service providers involved in compliance-sensitive operations</li>
        <li>Any new hire, executive, or advisor during their onboarding process</li>
        <li>All vendors, platform partners, or white-label participants operating under Penthian infrastructure</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Failure to adhere to this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment or contract, and may be reported to the relevant authorities where required by law.</p>

    <h2>3. Governance Structure</h2>
    <p>Penthian Ltd’s governance framework is built on clear accountability, layered oversight, and operational independence. The structure is designed to support strong internal controls, uphold regulatory obligations under the FSC, and ensure that decision-making is informed, ethical, and transparent.</p>

        <li>Approving high-risk client onboarding and enhanced due diligence cases</li>
        <li>Coordinating internal AML investigations and reporting to the Board</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The MLRO must be functionally independent from sales, marketing, and operations.</p>

    <h3>E. Internal Audit Function</h3>

        <li>Performing regular penetration tests and smart contract audits</li>
        <li>Collaborating with the Compliance Officer on system updates</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>G. Reporting Channels</h3>

    </ul>

    <h2>4. Roles & Responsibilities</h2>

    </ul>

    <h3>J. All Employees & Contractors</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Must complete AML/CFT and internal controls training</li>
        <li>Are expected to escalate suspicious or unusual activity</li>
        <li>Have access to anonymous reporting channels (see Section 13)</li>
        <li>Are responsible for protecting confidential information and client data</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This section ensures that no single individual has unchecked authority or unrestricted access to sensitive systems or client funds. Every key function has oversight, peer checks, and escalation points — helping maintain the security and trust Penthian promises its users.</p>

    <h2>5. Segregation of Duties</h2>
    <p>Segregation of duties (SoD) is a foundational principle of Penthian’s internal control framework. It ensures that no single individual or team has end-to-end control over any critical process — especially those involving financial transactions, compliance approvals, smart contract deployment, or client data.</p>
    <p>This division of responsibility reduces the risk of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fraud and misuse of authority</li>
        <li>Conflicts of interest</li>
        <li>Unintentional errors</li>
        <li>Unauthorized transactions</li>
        <li>Regulatory non-compliance</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>A. Key Areas Where SoD Is Enforced</h3>
    <h4>1. Onboarding & KYC</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Operations staff conduct first-level KYC and document collection</li>
        <li>Compliance Officer reviews and validates onboarding</li>
        <li>MLRO approves high-risk clients and enhanced due diligence (EDD) cases</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>2. Smart Contract Deployment</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Developers write code</li>
        <li>CTO or designated approver reviews code and signs off</li>
        <li>Smart contract auditor (internal or third-party) conducts formal audit</li>
        <li>Deployment key is held separately and requires dual-authorization (CTO + CEO or Compliance)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>3. Token Listing Approval</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Issuer onboarding handled by Business Development</li>
        <li>Legal review by Compliance and MLRO for KYB and regulatory risk</li>
        <li>Technical review by the CTO’s team for token contract structure</li>
        <li>Board or senior compliance officer gives final go-ahead for listing</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>4. Fund & Token Transfer Authority</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Wallet custody and treasury operations require multi-signature authorization</li>
        <li>No single party can move funds from custodial wallets or treasury pools</li>
        <li>All transactions are logged and must be reviewed weekly by Compliance</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>5. Access to Systems</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Tech Team maintains infrastructure but cannot access compliance data</li>
        <li>Compliance Team accesses onboarding data but has no backend code deployment authority</li>
        <li>Admin privileges are divided between CTO, COO, and Compliance, based on function</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>B. Role Rotation and Cross-Checking</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Penthian rotates staff in key operational positions (e.g., KYC review) at regular intervals</li>
        <li>Dual-review is required for sensitive approvals (e.g., wallet whitelisting, EDD clearance)</li>
        <li>Quarterly internal audits verify that no SoD violations have occurred</li>
        <li>SoD logic is enforced both at human and smart contract levels (via ERC-3643 permissioning)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>C. Exceptions Handling</h3>
    <p>In exceptional or urgent cases where segregation is temporarily bypassed (e.g., staff illness, system emergency), the following must occur:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A written exception request is logged with the Compliance Officer</li>
        <li>CEO or Board must approve the temporary measure</li>
        <li>Follow-up review of the event is conducted within 72 hours</li>
        <li>The reason and decision are documented and stored for audit purposes</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>D. Training & Monitoring</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>All staff are trained on SoD principles during onboarding and annually thereafter</li>
        <li>Any breach or conflict of interest must be reported immediately to the MLRO or via the Whistleblower Channel</li>
        <li>Automated systems (e.g., user onboarding, asset transfer, token listing) are built to enforce segregation through role-based access control and activity logs</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This strict enforcement of Segregation of Duties ensures that no single person has the power to compromise user funds, bypass compliance, or manipulate core processes — strengthening trust, transparency, and institutional resilience across the Penthian ecosystem.</p>

    <h2>6. Access Controls & Information Security</h2>
    <p>Protecting digital infrastructure, client data, wallet systems, and backend operational tools is central to Penthian’s risk management and compliance framework. This section outlines how access to systems, data, and smart contracts is tightly controlled and monitored to prevent unauthorized use, data breaches, and malicious attacks.</p>

    <h3>A. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)</h3>
    <p>Penthian enforces Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) across all systems — including its tokenization engine, wallet infrastructure, admin portals, and KYC/AML platforms. Access is granted based strictly on:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Role and department</li>
        <li>Operational necessity (least privilege principle)</li>
        <li>Segregation of Duties (Section 5)</li>
        <li>Executive or Compliance approval</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Examples:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Only the Compliance Team can access KYC records via Veriff.</li>
        <li>Only the CTO and assigned engineers can deploy or upgrade smart contracts.</li>
        <li>Only finance staff and MLRO can access transactional records and reporting logs.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All access changes are logged and reviewed quarterly.</p>

    <h3>B. Authentication & Credential Management</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>All internal systems require multi-factor authentication (MFA)</li>
        <li>Admin passwords must meet high-entropy standards and rotate every 90 days</li>
        <li>Use of hardware security modules (HSMs) or encrypted key vaults for sensitive credentials</li>
        <li>API keys for third-party systems are regularly rotated and access-scoped</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>C. Smart Contract and Wallet Security</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Wallets used for treasury, user assets, and smart contract deployment are multi-signature secured</li>
        <li>Smart contract upgrades are logged, require multi-person sign-off, and are reviewed before execution</li>
        <li>All smart contracts undergo periodic code audits and formal testing before launch</li>
        <li>ERC-3643 permissioning is used to prevent unauthorized token transfers and enforce compliance controls</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>D. Data Protection</h3>
    <p>All personal and sensitive data is:</p>
    <ul>

By combining strict internal permissions, encryption, and proactive monitoring, Penthian ensures that client assets, personal data, and operational systems remain secure, auditable, and protected from internal or external threats.</p>

    <h2>7. Operational Controls & Process Oversight</h2>
    <p>Penthian Ltd enforces structured operational procedures to ensure that daily activities are consistent, compliant, and auditable. These controls help detect deviations, reduce operational risk, and ensure the platform operates within the bounds of FSC regulations and internal risk appetite.</p>

    <h3>A. Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)</h3>
    <p>Each department operates under documented Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for critical processes, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>KYC/AML onboarding</li>
        <li>Tokenization of assets</li>
        <li>Secondary marketplace listings</li>
        <li>Smart contract upgrade deployments</li>
        <li>Wallet transactions</li>
        <li>Compliance monitoring</li>
        <li>Revenue distribution and payout events</li>
    </ul>
    <p>SOPs are version-controlled and reviewed semi-annually or when material changes to regulation, systems, or team structures occur.</p>

    <h3>B. Checklist-Based Execution</h3>
    <p>Operational tasks follow checklist-based workflows to reduce human error and enforce consistency. For example:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>KYC/AML onboarding requires step-by-step verification and approval checks</li>
        <li>Asset tokenization cannot proceed unless legal and technical reviews are signed off</li>
        <li>New user listings must be reviewed by Compliance before going live</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All checklists are stored digitally, timestamped, and linked to responsible staff members.</p>

    <h3>C. Approval Hierarchies</h3>
    <p>Key operational actions require layered approvals based on risk and impact level:</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Action</th>
            <th>Approver(s)</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Token listing (primary)</td>
            <td>Legal + Compliance + CTO</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Investor onboarding (high-risk)</td>
            <td>Compliance + MLRO</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Smart contract deployment</td>

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Contract approval for new vendors</td>
            <td>Department Head + Legal</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h3>D. Workflow Automation</h3>
    <p>Where appropriate, Penthian employs automation tools to enforce process integrity:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Veriff API auto-validates onboarding documents before Compliance review</li>
        <li>Token distribution, voting rights, and wallet permissions are executed via ERC-3643-compliant smart contracts</li>
        <li>Scheduled payout events and revenue distributions are automatically calculated and distributed based on smart contract logic</li>
        <li>Secondary trades are routed through pre-programmed compliance layers (e.g., AML screening and investor whitelist validation)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>E. Exception Management</h3>
    <p>Any deviations from standard processes (e.g., manual KYC clearance, out-of-cycle smart contract patch) require:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>A documented exception request</li>
        <li>Approval from Compliance and relevant executive</li>
        <li>A post-mortem review to prevent recurrence</li>
        <li>Notification to the Internal Auditor if material</li>
    </ol>
    <p>All exceptions are logged and included in the next audit cycle.</p>

    <h3>F. Departmental Oversight</h3>
    <p>Each department head is responsible for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ensuring their team follows SOPs and controls</li>
        <li>Monitoring process adherence through weekly reviews</li>
        <li>Escalating irregularities to the COO or Compliance</li>
        <li>Supporting audits and policy updates as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>G. Continuous Improvement</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Monthly internal retrospectives are conducted to refine operational workflows</li>
        <li>Feedback from clients, investors, and staff is gathered to identify friction points</li>
        <li>Updates to SOPs and workflows are rolled out with training and documentation</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By implementing robust operational controls, Penthian maintains consistency, scalability, and resilience in the face of business growth, technological evolution, and regulatory change. This discipline supports the trust users place in our platform and ensures the integrity of tokenized transactions at every level.</p>

    <h2>8. Compliance Monitoring & Escalation</h2>
    <p>Compliance is at the heart of Penthian’s platform integrity, especially as a licensed Virtual Asset Marketplace (Class S) under the FSC. This section outlines how compliance is continuously monitored and how violations, red flags, or breaches are identified, addressed, and escalated.</p>

    <h3>A. Ongoing Compliance Monitoring</h3>
    <p>The Compliance Officer is responsible for day-to-day monitoring of all activities that present compliance risk, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>KYC/KYB onboarding (via Veriff integration)</li>
        <li>Investor qualification (e.g., jurisdictional checks, risk profiling)</li>
        <li>AML transaction monitoring (via smart contract triggers and backend analytics)</li>
        <li>Adherence to internal policies (AML/CFT, internal controls, marketplace rules)</li>
        <li>Review of suspicious user behavior or complaints</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Monitoring activities are supported by automation and custom rules that trigger alerts when irregular patterns emerge — such as high-frequency trades, login anomalies, or unusual wallet behavior.</p>

    <h3>B. Smart Contract Compliance Logic</h3>
    <p>Through the integration of ERC-3643, Penthian enforces smart contract-level compliance by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ensuring only whitelisted investors can receive or transfer tokenized assets</li>
        <li>Blocking transfers involving blacklisted addresses or jurisdictions</li>
        <li>Linking token permissions directly to investor risk profile and KYC verification</li>
        <li>Disabling trading for expired or revoked credentials</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These logic layers reduce manual errors and improve regulatory reliability.</p>

    <h3>C. Red Flag Identification</h3>
    <p>Compliance monitors for a predefined set of red flags which may indicate:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Attempted identity fraud or fake documentation</li>
        <li>Investor accounts linked to high-risk jurisdictions</li>
        <li>Rapid buy-sell patterns inconsistent with investor profile</li>
        <li>Attempts to bypass platform limitations or use proxy wallets</li>
        <li>Complaints from users or whistleblowers indicating internal misconduct</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each red flag triggers an internal case, which is logged, timestamped, and assigned a risk score.</p>

    <h3>D. Internal Escalation Pathway</h3>
    <p>All red flags, suspicious transactions, or breaches follow a formal escalation process:</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Issue Level</th>
            <th>Handled By</th>
            <th>Timeframe</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Minor non-conformity</td>
            <td>Compliance Officer</td>
            <td>Within 3 business days</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Moderate irregularity</td>
            <td>Compliance + COO/CTO</td>
            <td>Within 48 hours</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>High-risk issue</td>
            <td>Compliance + MLRO + CEO</td>
            <td>Within 24 hours</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Criminal suspicion</td>
            <td>MLRO + Board + Notification to FIU</td>
            <td>Immediate</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
