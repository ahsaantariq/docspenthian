        <h2>4. Primary Offering Rules (Initial Token Sale)</h2>
        <p>The primary offering (also referred to as the Initial Token Sale or ITS) is the first opportunity for investors to acquire fractional ownership in a newly listed asset on the Penthian Marketplace. This section outlines the standards and rules governing how such offerings are structured, promoted, and executed to ensure compliance, fairness, and investor protection.</p>
        <h3>4.1 Definition</h3>
        <p>A Primary Offering is a fixed-period sale of asset-backed tokens issued directly by the asset owner or project sponsor (Issuer) to investors via the Penthian platform. These tokens represent ownership or economic rights in the underlying real-world asset.</p>
        <h3>4.2 Offer Types</h3>
        <p>Penthian supports several offering models, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fixed-Price Offerings:</strong> Tokens are sold at a predetermined price until the offering closes or reaches full subscription.</li>
            <li><strong>Time-Bound Offerings:</strong> Investors have a set number of days to subscribe, regardless of how many tokens are sold.</li>
            <li><strong>Target Raise Offerings:</strong> A funding threshold must be met (e.g. soft cap / hard cap) for the offering to be successful.</li>
            <li><strong>Auction-Based Offerings:</strong> Where investor demand sets token price through a bidding mechanism.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each offering model must be pre-approved by Penthian’s Listings and Compliance teams.</p>
        <h3>4.3 Offering Requirements</h3>
        <p>Each Initial Token Sale must meet the following criteria:</p>
        <p><strong>a. Clear Offer Documentation</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Investor Offer Summary (token price, number of tokens, minimum contribution)</li>
            <li>Risk Disclosure Statement</li>
            <li>Token Terms and Conditions</li>
            <li>Expected yield/ROI disclosure (if applicable)</li>
            <li>Exit strategy (e.g. buyback clause, resale liquidity option)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>b. Duration and Limits</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Maximum offer duration: 90 days</li>
            <li>Minimum and maximum investment limits may be imposed per investor (based on jurisdiction and KYC level)</li>
            <li>Token purchase lockup period, if any, must be clearly disclosed</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>c. Wallet & Smart Contract Setup</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Tokens must be deployed from a whitelisted, verified issuer wallet</li>
            <li>Investor wallets must be KYC-verified and linked to a Veriff-verified profile</li>
            <li>Smart contract must restrict token transfer until offering period is closed</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>4.4 Marketing & Promotion Guidelines</h3>
        <p>Issuers must adhere to strict guidelines:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>No misleading or guaranteed-return statements</li>
            <li>All marketing content must be pre-approved by Penthian</li>
            <li>Jurisdictional restrictions must be respected in advertising (e.g. MiCA, ASIC, SEC restrictions)</li>
            <li>Promotions must include disclaimers and clearly indicate that token purchases carry risk</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>4.4 Oversubscription & Allocation</h3>
        <p>In the case of oversubscription:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Allocation is made on a first-come, first-served basis or</li>
            <li>A pro-rata distribution is used based on the amount of funds committed</li>
            <li>Excess funds are returned automatically via smart contract or manually (if in fiat)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>4.5 Completion & Settlement</h3>
        <p>Once the offering ends:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Tokens are released to investor wallets</li>
            <li>Smart contract functions unlock secondary trading (if applicable)</li>
            <li>Issuer receives funds (minus platform fees, held in escrow if required)</li>
            <li>A post-offering update is sent to all investors confirming allocation and next steps</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>5. Secondary Market Rules</h2>
        <p>Penthian’s secondary market allows investors to buy and sell previously issued asset-backed tokens directly with each other. This creates liquidity for fractional ownership and enhances price discovery. To ensure transparency, fairness, and regulatory alignment, all secondary trading is governed by the rules below.</p>
        <h3>5.1 Definition</h3>

            <li>Fraud or suspicious activity is identified</li>

        <h2>6. Smart Contract Standards & Compliance</h2>
        <p>Penthian’s tokenized assets operate using Ethereum-based smart contract standards to ensure compliance, interoperability, and investor safety. This section defines the technical requirements for tokenization and compliance controls embedded within the platform’s smart contracts.</p>
        <h3>6.1 Approved Token Standards</h3>
        <p>Penthian supports the following Ethereum token standards for asset tokenization:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>ERC-20:</strong> For compliance-controlled real estate or regulated markets with fungible tokens.</li>
            <li><strong>ERC-721:</strong> For unique, non-fungible assets such as individual properties or collectibles.</li>
            <li><strong>ERC-1155:</strong> For multi-use or fractional tokens representing SMEs or mixed-asset portfolios.</li>
            <li><strong>ERC-3643:</strong> For identity-linked compliance tokens that enforce KYC/KYB and jurisdictional restrictions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All tokens must be audited by a Penthian-approved third-party auditor before deployment.</p>
        <h3>6.2 Compliance Features</h3>
        <p>Smart contracts on Penthian include built-in compliance features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>KYC/AML Integration:</strong> Only wallets with valid ERC-3643 identity tokens can interact with asset-backed tokens.</li>
            <li><strong>Transfer Restrictions:</strong> Tokens can only be transferred to KYC-verified wallets in non-restricted jurisdictions.</li>
            <li><strong>Investor Caps:</strong> Contracts enforce limits on the number of investors or token holdings per wallet, as required by law.</li>
            <li><strong>Freeze Mechanisms:</strong> Admin or multi-sig wallets can pause token activity in case of regulatory or security issues.</li>
            <li><strong>Revocation Logic:</strong> Ability to invalidate tokens or revoke access for non-compliant users.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>6.3 Audit & Security Requirements</h3>
        <p>All smart contracts must:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Undergo a full security audit by a reputable third-party firm</li>
            <li>Be tested for vulnerabilities (e.g., reentrancy, overflow, unauthorized access)</li>
            <li>Include emergency pause and upgrade mechanisms (with multi-sig governance)</li>
            <li>Be deployed on a Penthian-approved blockchain (e.g., Ethereum, Polygon)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Audit reports are made available to investors upon request.</p>
        <h3>6.4 On-Chain & Off-Chain Compliance</h3>
        <p>Penthian maintains compliance through a combination of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>On-Chain:</strong> Smart contract logic for identity, transfer restrictions, and governance.</li>
            <li><strong>Off-Chain:</strong> KYC/KYB verification via Veriff, legal reviews, and regulatory reporting.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This hybrid approach ensures compliance with both blockchain and traditional financial regulations.</p>
