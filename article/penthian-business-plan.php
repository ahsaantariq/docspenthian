        <h2>3. Vision & Mission</h2>
        <h3>Our Vision</h3>
        <p>To build the global financial infrastructure for a borderless digital ownership economy, where access to wealth creation is no longer limited by geography, capital, or legal complexity.</p>
        <p>We envision a world where ownership is democratized, transparent, and programmable, where any individual, anywhere in the world, can own a stake in real estate, businesses, or valuable assets through secure, regulated digital tokens.</p>
        <p>Penthian is not just a platform. It’s a system, structured, principled, and global, that enables shared prosperity through tokenized, fractional ownership of the world’s most meaningful assets.</p>
        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
        <p>To redefine ownership by enabling people to co-own real-world assets through compliant tokenization, unlocking access to wealth creation for everyday investors, entrepreneurs, and global communities.</p>
        <p>We are on a mission to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Tokenize and fractionalize income-generating real estate and businesses</li>
            <li>Bridge traditional asset classes with blockchain-based liquidity</li>
            <li>Offer a seamless experience for investors to buy, hold, trade, and benefit from real-world asset value</li>
            <li>Uphold the highest standards of regulatory compliance, security, and investor protection</li>
            <li>Empower communities to build collective wealth and stewardship through on-chain governance</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What Makes Us Different</h3>
        <p>Penthian combines deep industry knowledge in real estate and finance with the most advanced blockchain standards. We do not compromise between compliance and innovation. We build with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>ERC-3643 permissioned transfer standards for regulatory-grade compliance</li>
            <li>Veriff KYC and anti-money laundering controls embedded into every onboarding and transfer</li>
            <li>Rental distribution, auction functionality, and on-chain voting as core platform features</li>
            <li>A foundational commitment to transparency, ethics, and values inspired by Christian principles and the Fruits of the Spirit</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Penthian is not just a platform for buying tokens — it’s a movement for people to own what matters.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>4. Background & Genesis of Penthian</h2>
        <p>Penthian was born out of a personal vision, tested through real-life experience in the property and hospitality industry, and sharpened by the possibilities of blockchain technology.</p>
        <h3>The Problem We Saw</h3>
        <p>For years, our founder Godwill Soma worked in senior leadership roles across the hotel, accommodation, and property industries in Australia. While managing multimillion-dollar buildings and negotiating large leasing deals, he constantly encountered one limiting reality: ownership was only accessible to the wealthy.</p>
        <p>His colleagues, many of whom helped build, clean, or manage these assets, could never dream of owning them. Meanwhile, developers often had unsold apartments or stalled capital due to poor exit strategies and at times tough market conditions. On the investor side, people wanted access to income-generating real estate, but entry costs, legal complexities, and liquidity barriers kept them out.</p>
        <p>There had to be a better way.</p>
        <h3>The Early Ideas</h3>
        <p>Before blockchain, Godwill explored co-ownership using traditional legal structures. He consulted conveyancers, lawyers and mortgage brokers, including CPA and CA accountants and explored ways for groups to co-buy apartments or hotels. The legal setup was inefficient, the cost was high, and the model didn’t scale.</p>
        <p>In 2018, he discovered Ethereum. After seeing a friend profit from trading crypto in 2019, he dove deep into smart contracts, decentralization, and fractional asset ownership. He realized blockchain could solve every friction point: legal, financial, and operational that he had faced in traditional co-ownership.</p>
        <p>He tried to explain this to his father, a priest and former mechanic in Africa, using real estate examples: “Imagine if an apartment building could issue digital shares to investors, and everything ran like an automated business on the blockchain.” It didn’t fully make sense to his father then, but it became a defining moment. The vision became clear.</p>
        <h3>From Fractuate to Penthian</h3>
        <p>The original concept began under the name Fractuate — a platform to allow people to co-own hotels, real estate, and businesses. Over time, the vision matured. The technology advanced. The brand evolved.</p>
        <p>By 2024, Fractuate had built:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A live tokenization and trading platform</li>
            <li>A working MVP using ERC-721, ERC-1155, and later ERC-3643</li>
            <li>Integration with Veriff for full KYC</li>
            <li>A self-custody wallet under development</li>
            <li>Functional modules for rental income distribution, secondary market auctions, and on-chain voting</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As the platform matured, a new name was needed, one that reflected structure, balance, trust, and long-term vision. Thus, Penthian was born.</p>
        <h3>Why Mauritius?</h3>
        <p>Mauritius is strategically positioned as a compliant, blockchain-friendly jurisdiction. It offers strong regulatory clarity and international credibility — making it the ideal base for Penthian to apply for its Class S VASP license and operate globally with integrity.</p>

        <h2>6. Regulatory Framework & Class S Justification</h2>
        <h3>Overview of Mauritius’ VASP Regulatory Framework</h3>
        <p>Mauritius has established itself as a progressive jurisdiction for virtual asset innovation through the Virtual Asset and Initial Token Offering Services Act 2021 (VAITOS Act). This framework brings clarity, transparency, and international alignment to the regulation of virtual asset service providers (VASPs), while promoting innovation through responsible licensing and compliance enforcement by the Financial Services Commission (FSC).</p>
        <p>Under this act, Mauritius recognizes several classes of virtual asset services. Penthian Ltd is applying for the Class S – Virtual Asset Marketplace license, which is best aligned with our business model and operations.</p>
        <h3>Why Class S (Marketplace License)?</h3>
        <p>Penthian is not a simple token issuer or trading desk. We are building a compliant, multi-layered marketplace that allows real-world assets — such as real estate and SMEs — to be fractionalized, listed, traded, governed, and financially managed through blockchain technology. The Class S license is the only one within Mauritius’ framework that fits this complete model.</p>
        <h4>Key marketplace functions under Class S include:</h4>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Function</th>
                <th>Penthian Implementation</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Listing & Tokenization</td>
                <td>Asset owners (developers, businesses) list tokenized real-world assets through compliant ERC-3643 smart contracts</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Primary Market</td>
                <td>Investors purchase fractional ownership in vetted, income-generating assets</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Secondary Market</td>
                <td>Peer-to-peer trading of tokens through an integrated exchange module</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Governance</td>
                <td>Investors participate in on-chain voting and proposals related to tokenized assets</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Asset Distribution</td>
                <td>Investors receive rental yield or profit share based on token holdings</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>AML/KYC Compliance</td>
                <td>All onboarding and transactions are KYC-verified through Veriff, with additional AML protocols in place</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <h3>Scope of Operation Under Class S License</h3>
        <p>Penthian will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Operate a full digital asset marketplace from Mauritius</li>
            <li>Tokenize and fractionalize physical assets (real estate, business ownership)</li>
            <li>Enable primary listings and secondary trading of virtual asset tokens</li>
            <li>Support both retail and sophisticated investors, with different onboarding tiers</li>
            <li>Secure client assets using self-custody architecture or integrated custodial partners</li>
            <li>Maintain full compliance with AML/CFT laws through risk-based transaction monitoring</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Why Mauritius?</h3>
        <p>Mauritius offers the perfect jurisdictional foundation for Penthian because:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>It has legal clarity and enforceable licensing for VASPs (unlike many emerging markets)</li>
            <li>It is recognized by the FATF and EU as a compliant, risk-sensitive jurisdiction</li>

        <h3>A. End-to-End Platform Workflow</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Asset Listing & Tokenization (Primary Market)</strong>
                <ul>

                    <li>Tokens are issued to investors who complete KYC onboarding</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> A developer lists a $1M apartment project, splits it into 10,000 tokens at $100 each, and offers them through the primary market portal.</p>
            </li>

                </ul>
                <p>This module supports both manual and automated rent entry uploads from property managers.</p>
            </li>

                    <li>Each token is non-fungible and uniquely linked to a specific asset</li>
                    <li>Includes metadata such as title deed reference, location, valuation date, etc.</li>
                    <li>Ideal for auction or resale of 1-of-1 properties or units</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Use Case:</strong> A penthouse unit sold as a single, exclusive token.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>ERC-1155 – Fractionalized Multi-Asset Tokens</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Enables fractional ownership of a single asset or a bundle of assets</li>
                    <li>Highly gas-efficient and supports batch minting and transfers</li>
                    <li>Suitable for tokenizing apartments, hotel rooms, co-working spaces, and equity stakes in businesses</li>
                    <li>Used for both the primary and secondary markets</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Use Case:</strong> A $1M hotel floor split into 10,000 shares — each investor gets one or more ERC-1155 tokens.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>ERC-3643 – Permissioned Identity-Linked Tokens</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Adds compliance and transfer controls at the smart contract level</li>
                    <li>Each token is identity-bound — only whitelisted users (via KYC provider) can receive or transfer tokens</li>
                    <li>Perfect for jurisdictions requiring securities-compliant tokenization</li>
                    <li>Enables fine-grained investor segmentation (retail vs accredited)</li>
                    <li>Includes issuer-enforced restrictions (geofencing, transfer delays, lockups)</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Use Case:</strong> A tokenized commercial building offered only to verified investors in compliant jurisdictions.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>B. Compliance & Identity Layer: ERC-3643 + Veriff Integration</h3>
        <ul>

            </li>
            <li><strong>Risk Profiling</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Risk score generated based on jurisdiction, source of funds, transaction behavior</li>
                    <li>Determines access tier and token eligibility</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Wallet Binding</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Upon approval, the user’s wallet address is whitelisted and linked to their verified identity</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Re-verification</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Required periodically or when suspicious activity is detected</li>

        </table>
        <p>This system supports both retail and accredited/sophisticated investor models, in compliance with asset class rules and geographic restrictions.</p>
        <h3>D. AML Transaction Monitoring & Reporting</h3>
        <p>All transactions (on-chain and off-chain) are monitored using Veriff’s transaction risk engine and Penthian’s internal controls. This includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Suspicious pattern detection (rapid inflows/outflows, wash trading)</li>
            <li>Geo-risk mapping</li>
            <li>Fiat-to-crypto conversion tracking</li>
            <li>Immediate alerts for flagged behavior</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) will be filed with the appropriate authorities in Mauritius as required under the FIAMLR 2018.</p>
        <h3>E. Integration with ERC-3643</h3>
        <p>Veriff’s verification is tightly linked to our ERC-3643 smart contracts. Only wallets belonging to verified users can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Purchase newly issued tokens</li>
            <li>Receive tokens via secondary trading</li>
            <li>Participate in governance voting</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If a user is de-verified or flagged, their wallet is automatically blacklisted from receiving or transferring tokens — ensuring compliance is enforced on-chain, not just off-chain.</p>
        <h3>F. Recordkeeping & Regulator Access</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>All KYC/AML records are securely stored and encrypted for a minimum of 7 years, in line with Mauritius FSC requirements.</li>
            <li>Regulators may request direct access to verification logs or transaction trails.</li>
            <li>Data is protected under GDPR and local privacy laws, with user consent secured during onboarding.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Through our partnership with Veriff and our smart contract-level enforcement, Penthian ensures that every investor and issuer is known, verified, and screened — creating a secure and trustworthy ecosystem aligned with global best practices.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>12. Tokenization Model & Asset Classes</h2>
        <p>Penthian’s core innovation lies in the tokenization of real-world, income-producing assets into blockchain-based digital tokens. Our approach combines robust legal structuring with programmable smart contracts — enabling fractional ownership, liquidity, governance, and yield distribution.</p>
        <p>We tokenize real-world assets using standards like ERC-721, ERC-1155, and ERC-3643, depending on the asset type, investor profile, and compliance needs.</p>
        <h3>A. Legal & Structural Foundation</h3>
        <p>Each tokenized asset listed on Penthian is backed by a legally enforceable structure that ensures:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The underlying real-world asset (e.g. property or business) is held by a registered legal entity (often a Special Purpose Vehicle or trust)</li>
            <li>The digital tokens represent beneficial ownership, equity rights, or yield entitlements from that entity</li>
            <li>Token holders receive legal documentation outlining their rights, responsibilities, and revenue share</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This model protects investors and provides transparency, while enabling global participation in local assets.</p>
        <h3>B. Supported Asset Classes</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Real Estate</strong>
                <p>Real estate tokenization is the foundation of Penthian’s offering. Properties are fractionalized to allow small and large investors to participate in ownership and rental returns.</p>
                <p><strong>Eligible Property Types:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Residential apartments and units</li>
                    <li>Commercial office buildings</li>
                    <li>Hotel rooms and co-living spaces</li>
                    <li>Co-working hubs and short-term rental portfolios</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Use Cases:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sell unsold developer stock</li>
                    <li>Unlock equity from held properties</li>
                    <li>Co-invest in income-generating projects</li>
                    <li>Offer shared hotel ownership with income distribution</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Small & Medium Enterprises (SMEs)</strong>
                <p>Penthian allows profitable private businesses to raise capital by tokenizing equity or future revenue streams.</p>
                <p><strong>SME Tokenization Models:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Equity tokens representing shares in a private company</li>
                    <li>Revenue-sharing tokens tied to a percentage of turnover</li>
                    <li>Hybrid profit-and-control models for angel-style investors</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Example Use Cases:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A family-run logistics company tokenizes 20% of its equity to raise $200,000</li>
                    <li>A retail franchise offers revenue-sharing tokens to early supporters</li>
                    <li>Local cafés, gyms, or salons offer community-based co-ownership</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Specialized Assets (Future Expansion)</strong>
                <p>As regulations allow and infrastructure matures, Penthian will support:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Commodities (e.g. tokenized gold, oil, or agri-assets)</li>
                    <li>Collectibles (e.g. tokenized wine, art, or luxury watches)</li>
                    <li>Renewable energy assets (e.g. tokenized solar farms or carbon credits)</li>
                    <li>Royalties & Intellectual Property</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>C. Token Design Models</h3>
        <p>Each token type is mapped to a specific asset class, investor base, and compliance level:</p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Token Standard</th>
                <th>Use Case</th>
                <th>Compliance</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>ERC-721</td>
                <td>Single-ownership real estate (e.g. one unit, one token)</td>
                <td>Light KYC</td>
                <td>Unique asset token with metadata</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>ERC-1155</td>
                <td>Fractional property or business ownership</td>
                <td>Medium KYC</td>
                <td>Multi-owner, cost-efficient, batch transfer support</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>ERC-3643</td>
                <td>Security token for regulated markets</td>
                <td>Full KYC</td>
                <td>Permissioned, identity-bound, investor tiering enforced</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>Each token can also include metadata such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Asset ID and legal wrapper</li>
            <li>Rental or profit share percentage</li>
            <li>Voting rights</li>
            <li>Lockup or vesting terms</li>
            <li>Yield payout schedule</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>D. Governance & Ownership Rights</h3>
        <p>Token holders may be granted:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Income rights (via smart contracts)</li>
            <li>Voting rights in property or business decisions</li>
            <li>Pre-emptive rights or buyback privileges (optional)</li>
            <li>Priority in future offerings (e.g. VIP access or governance rewards)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Penthian uses these rights to mirror traditional asset ownership models, but with added liquidity, compliance, and automation.</p>
        <h3>E. Asset Vetting & Listing Criteria</h3>
        <p>Before any asset is tokenized and listed, it must pass a due diligence process that includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Title deed and ownership verification</li>
            <li>Financial performance assessment</li>
            <li>Market valuation and appraisal</li>
            <li>Legal compliance review (including zoning, licensing, etc.)</li>
            <li>Sponsor background checks</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Asset quality is critical to platform trust. Listings are reviewed by the internal compliance team and, where required, third-party validators.</p>
        <h3>F. Yield Distribution</h3>
        <p>Token holders receive rental income or revenue share through:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Smart contract-based distribution (USDC or stablecoin equivalents)</li>
            <li>Transparent, auditable yield history</li>
            <li>Optional compounding or reinvestment options in future</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Yields are distributed pro-rata based on token holdings, and full distribution logs are available in the investor dashboard and on-chain.</p>
        <p>Through this tokenization model, Penthian enables:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Global capital to flow into real-world assets</li>
            <li>Local entrepreneurs and developers to access new funding pathways</li>

        <h2>13. Compliance, Risk & Investor Protections</h2>
        <p>At the heart of Penthian’s platform is a commitment to building a secure, compliant, and transparent environment where users can invest in tokenized real-world assets with confidence. Our compliance and risk framework has been designed not only to meet Mauritius’ Virtual Asset and Initial Token Offering Services Act 2021, but also to align with global standards such as FATF, MiCA (EU), and AFSL (Australia).</p>
        <p>Our approach combines smart contract-level enforcement with traditional financial controls, underpinned by values like integrity, responsibility, and stewardship — principles drawn from our spiritual foundation.</p>
        <h3>A. Compliance Framework</h3>
        <p>Penthian’s compliance program includes the following core layers:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>KYC & Identity Verification</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Veriff integration ensures identity verification for all users (issuers, investors, and agents)</li>
                    <li>Sanctions, PEP, and adverse media checks are performed automatically</li>
                    <li>Investor wallet addresses are linked to their compliance status (via ERC-3643)</li>
                    <li>Tiered onboarding process allows for different user rights depending on risk level</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>AML & CFT Controls</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Transaction monitoring system detects suspicious behavior (e.g., rapid trades, flagged regions)</li>
                    <li>Automatic alerts for high-risk activity or abnormal transaction sizes</li>
                    <li>Manual review and reporting to local authorities (SARs) by appointed MLRO</li>
                    <li>Ongoing screening of wallet activity and KYC updates</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Geo-Fencing & Jurisdictional Controls</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Access is restricted based on investor geography</li>
                    <li>Users from restricted countries (e.g. US, Canada, India, Singapore) are blocked unless licensed locally</li>
                    <li>Token transfers are disabled between blacklisted regions through smart contract rules</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>B. Risk Management Strategy</h3>
        <p>Penthian has adopted a Risk-Based Approach (RBA) to mitigate operational, financial, legal, and reputational risks.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Operational Risk</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Smart contracts are audited before deployment</li>
                    <li>Platform has multi-signature controls and admin access separation</li>
                    <li>Backups, failovers, and disaster recovery procedures are in place</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Market & Liquidity Risk</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Liquidity management rules for secondary market trading</li>
                    <li>Pricing bands and circuit breakers to reduce volatility</li>
                    <li>Clear disclosures to users about market risks and token illiquidity</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Custody & Asset Protection Risk</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Self-custody model with optional third-party custody integration</li>
                    <li>Investor tokens are held in wallet addresses only accessible by the user</li>
                    <li>Yield and fiat distributions are processed through smart contracts or regulated channels</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Legal & Regulatory Risk</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Legal review of each tokenized asset and jurisdictional offering</li>
                    <li>Regular review of new global regulations (MiCA, VARA, FCA, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Legal advisors engaged across Mauritius, Australia, and UAE</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>C. Investor Protection Measures</h3>
        <p>We protect investors through a mix of technical enforcement, legal structuring, and community governance:</p>

        </table>
        <h3>D. Governance and Transparency</h3>
        <p>We aim to build a transparent ecosystem where investors not only benefit financially, but participate in platform decision-making.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>On-chain governance for major updates and proposals</li>
            <li>Investor dashboards for real-time data on holdings, yields, and asset performance</li>
            <li>Regular reporting (quarterly project updates, asset performance, rent collections)</li>
            <li>Auditable logs of trades, distributions, and votes</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>E. Ethical Foundation: Fruits of the Spirit</h3>
        <p>Beyond regulation, Penthian is governed by timeless values. Our platform and community are shaped by the Fruits of the Spirit, which we’ve embedded into our company culture and user conduct policies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Love</strong> – Respect and care for each investor and partner</li>
            <li><strong>Joy</strong> – A platform that empowers financial dignity</li>
            <li><strong>Peace</strong> – Built-in dispute resolution, investor clarity</li>

        <h2>14. Custody & Asset Safeguarding Mechanisms</h2>
        <p>Custody and asset protection are core pillars of trust in any financial ecosystem — especially in tokenized real-world asset marketplaces. Penthian has adopted a hybrid custody framework that supports both self-custody for users and institutional-grade safeguards for underlying physical assets and fiat flows.</p>
        <p>Our model is designed to meet the FSC’s expectations for secure client asset handling, while also aligning with the best practices in crypto-native and traditional financial systems.</p>
        <h3>A. Digital Asset Custody (Investor Tokens)</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Self-Custody by Default</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Penthian users receive their asset tokens (ERC-721, 1155, or 3643) directly to their self-custody wallet</li>
                    <li>The wallet is whitelisted and KYC-bound through ERC-3643 and Veriff integration</li>
                    <li>Users control their private keys and can view ownership history and yield payouts in real time</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This reduces counterparty risk and aligns with Web3 values of user empowerment.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Optional Custodial Wallet Services (Phase 2)</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Institutional or high-value investors may opt for regulated third-party custody</li>
                    <li>Penthian will integrate with licensed custodians in Mauritius, UAE, or EU jurisdictions</li>
                    <li>Institutional wallets will follow segregation rules and offer audit trails for compliance</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>B. Smart Contract Safeguards</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Asset Whitelisting & Freezing</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Only approved token contracts can interact with the marketplace</li>
                    <li>Admin-level controls allow the freezing of suspicious tokens (pending legal investigation or security breaches)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Emergency Pause Function</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Contracts include a “pause” mechanism in case of hacks, exploits, or regulatory intervention</li>
                    <li>All transactions can be temporarily halted and reviewed</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Compliance-Enforced Transfers</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>ERC-3643 contracts check sender and receiver wallet status before allowing any transfer</li>
                    <li>Blacklisted, unverified, or expired users are automatically restricted from receiving assets</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Role-Based Permissions</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Only verified roles (issuer, compliance officer, admin, investor) can execute functions like:</li>
                    <li>Minting new tokens</li>
                    <li>Approving listings</li>
                    <li>Distributing yield</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>C. Yield & Revenue Safeguarding</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Smart Contract Distribution</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Rent and business revenues are distributed to token holders using automated smart contracts</li>
                    <li>Revenue flows are recorded on-chain and available in user dashboards</li>
                    <li>Payouts are made in stablecoins (e.g., USDC) to protect value from volatility</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Escrow Logic for Primary Sales</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Funds collected from primary offerings are held in escrow until:</li>
                    <li>Minimum raise target is met</li>
                    <li>Compliance checks are complete</li>
                    <li>Token issuance is successful</li>
                    <li>If a raise fails, funds are returned to investors automatically via the contract.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Payment Processing & Banking Integration</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Penthian will work with licensed payment providers for:</li>
                    <li>Fiat-to-stablecoin conversion</li>
                    <li>Secure fiat yield distributions</li>
                    <li>Rent collection from property managers</li>
                    <li>All service partners must meet AML, data protection, and auditing standards</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>D. Underlying Physical Asset Protection</h3>
        <p>Token ownership is only valuable if the real-world asset behind it is secure, legally compliant, and revenue-generating.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Legal Structuring</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Every tokenized asset is held through a legally registered SPV or trust structure</li>
                    <li>Investors receive clear documentation proving their interest in the underlying entity</li>
                    <li>Shareholders’ agreements or token terms clearly outline:</li>
                    <li>Yield rights</li>
                    <li>Governance rights</li>
                    <li>Liquidation terms</li>
                    <li>Dispute resolution</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Property & Business Management</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Penthian works with licensed property managers or asset operators to ensure:</li>
                    <li>Rent is collected, maintained, and distributed</li>
                    <li>Maintenance and operations are performed professionally</li>
                    <li>Occupancy and yield targets are met</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Insurance & Physical Risk Mitigation</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Properties are insured under commercial landlord policies</li>
                    <li>In the future, Penthian will explore platform-wide insurance coverages for:</li>
                    <li>Custody risk</li>
                    <li>Smart contract exploits</li>
                    <li>Business continuity</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>E. Data Security & Asset Metadata Integrity</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>All token metadata (e.g., valuation, title deed, performance data) is stored on-chain or in tamper-proof IPFS repositories</li>
            <li>Changes to metadata require admin-level governance votes or compliance sign-off</li>
            <li>Access logs are maintained for all administrative functions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Through this layered approach, Penthian ensures that both the digital tokens and the real-world assets they represent are safeguarded — legally, technically, and financially. This structure allows us to serve investors of all levels with the confidence of institutional-grade protection.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>15. Platform Governance & Voting Rights</h2>
        <p>Penthian is not just a platform for transacting — it is a participatory ecosystem where verified investors and asset holders can govern key decisions relating to their tokenized assets. We believe governance is not an optional feature; it’s a core right of ownership.</p>
        <p>Our governance model is designed to be transparent, on-chain, and compliance-aligned, allowing fractional investors to collectively vote on proposals while preventing manipulation or regulatory risk.</p>
        <h3>A. Governance Philosophy</h3>
        <p>Governance at Penthian reflects our core belief in stewardship, fairness, and collective decision-making. Ownership must include both economic participation and voting power — responsibly exercised and transparently recorded.</p>
        <p>We do not operate as a DAO in the traditional sense, but we adopt DAO-lite principles where permitted by regulation. Our governance model is particularly inspired by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Real-world shareholder frameworks</li>
            <li>On-chain token governance protocols</li>
            <li>Community voting mechanisms</li>
            <li>Biblical values of stewardship, wisdom, and accountability</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>B. Governance Rights for Token Holders</h3>
        <p>Depending on the asset and token structure, investors may receive governance rights to vote on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Asset-level decisions:</strong></li>
            <li>Property sales or refinancing</li>
            <li>Major renovations or value-add projects</li>
            <li>Change of asset manager or operator</li>
            <li><strong>Revenue decisions:</strong></li>
            <li>Use of reserves or profit distribution schedules</li>
            <li><strong>Platform-level proposals:</strong></li>
            <li>Feature upgrades</li>
            <li>Token utility changes</li>
            <li>Fee adjustments or new asset class additions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each governance vote is tied to a specific smart contract (e.g., property SPV or token contract) and only eligible token holders can participate.</p>
        <h3>C. Voting Structure</h3>
        <p>Voting is executed through an on-chain module integrated into the Penthian dashboard. Key features include:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Voting Weight</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Weighted by the number of tokens held</li>
                    <li>Option for cap or multiplier (e.g., one token = one vote or graduated tiers)</li>
                    <li>Snapshots are taken at the proposal creation time to prevent manipulation</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Eligibility</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Only wallets that are KYC-verified via Veriff are allowed to vote</li>
                    <li>For security tokens (ERC-3643), only verified “qualified investors” may vote if required by law</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Quorum & Approval Thresholds</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Configurable quorum thresholds (e.g., 10% token holder participation required)</li>
                    <li>Approval thresholds vary by proposal type (simple majority or supermajority)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

        <h3>E. Governance Token (Optional Future Feature)</h3>
        <p>Penthian may introduce a native governance token (non-securitized) to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Allow trusted users to participate in global platform governance</li>
            <li>Propose or approve platform-wide initiatives (e.g. protocol changes)</li>
            <li>Earn incentives through participation and community contribution</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This token would be issued only after regulatory clarity, and not used as a financial instrument or investment offer.</p>

        <h3>F. Transparency & Auditability</h3>
        <p>All voting activity is recorded:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>On-chain and visible through blockchain explorers</li>
            <li>In-dashboard with proposal summaries and results</li>
            <li>In reports downloadable by regulators, asset issuers, and investors</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Governance history is permanent, searchable, and tamper-proof.</p>

        <h3>G. Dispute Resolution</h3>
        <p>If a governance outcome is disputed:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Token holders may file a formal complaint or request reconsideration</li>
            <li>A platform-level governance committee (comprising internal team + external advisors) can review decisions under exceptional cases</li>
            <li>Emergency override powers are strictly limited to compliance, fraud prevention, or force majeure</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Penthian’s governance system gives token holders the power to protect and grow their investments, build collective confidence, and shape the future of digital ownership — responsibly and transparently.</p>

        <h2>16. Revenue Model & Fee Structure</h2>
        <p>Penthian is designed to be a high-integrity, revenue-generating platform that creates sustainable value for investors, issuers, and the business itself. Our model monetizes the lifecycle of tokenized assets — from initial onboarding to secondary market activity and ongoing asset performance — while aligning with the needs of both small and large stakeholders.</p>
        <p>Our revenue model is structured to be transparent, scalable, and compliant with financial regulations in Mauritius and any future licensing jurisdictions.</p>

        <h3>A. Primary Revenue Streams</h3>
        <h4>1. Listing Fees (Asset Issuers)</h4>
        <p>Asset owners and developers pay a one-time listing fee to tokenize and list an asset on Penthian’s primary marketplace.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Fee range: $1,000 – $10,000 USD</li>
            <li>Based on asset class, complexity, and compliance support required</li>
            <li>Covers legal vetting, token contract deployment, documentation upload, and launch marketing</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This revenue is front-loaded and helps cover tokenization and onboarding overhead.</p>

        <h4>2. Primary Token Sale Commission</h4>
        <p>Penthian charges a percentage-based commission on the amount raised during a token sale (e.g., real estate or SME raise).</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Typical rate: 2% – 5% of funds raised</li>
            <li>Deducted automatically from proceeds held in escrow</li>
            <li>Issuers receive net funds after deductions, with full transparency</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>3. Secondary Market Transaction Fees</h4>
        <p>Every buy/sell transaction on the secondary marketplace incurs a trading fee.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Standard fee: 0.25% – 1% per side (buyer and/or seller)</li>
            <li>Applied at settlement and distributed in-platform or as stablecoin deduction</li>
            <li>Discounts may apply for high-volume or long-term holders</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>4. Rental Yield & Revenue Distribution Processing</h4>
        <p>For each income-generating asset, Penthian may charge a processing/admin fee on yield distribution.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Typical: 1% – 2% of total distributed amount</li>
            <li>Covers reporting, treasury operations, conversion, and smart contract execution</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This can also be built into issuer agreements so investors receive full yield with fees paid from issuer’s end.</p>

        <h4>5. Governance & Proposal Fees (Optional/Future)</h4>
        <p>In governance-enabled assets:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Asset managers or large token holders may pay a small fee to submit proposals (anti-spam)</li>
            <li>This may also act as a bond, refundable if proposal passes</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>B. Future & Optional Revenue Streams</h3>
        <h4>1. Custody Services (Optional for Institutions)</h4>
        <p>In the future, institutional clients may pay custody or asset safekeeping fees through integrated third-party custodians.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed monthly or asset-under-custody (AUC) model</li>
            <li>Optional cold storage for high-value tokens or private placements</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>2. White-Label Tokenization Services</h4>
        <p>Penthian may offer B2B tokenization tools to developers, funds, or real estate firms.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Monthly SaaS or per-asset pricing model</li>
            <li>Includes custom contract generation, API integration, and compliance onboarding</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>3. Featured Listings & Promotions</h4>
        <p>Issuers can pay to have their listings promoted:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Homepage features</li>
            <li>Email campaigns</li>
            <li>Targeted outreach to investor segments</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>4. Agent & Referral Program Revenue</h4>
        <p>Third-party agents (developers, sales brokers, property managers) may earn referral fees or commissions — and Penthian may share in the revenue generated through their channels.</p>

        <h3>C. Fee Transparency & Disclosure</h3>
        <p>All fees are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Publicly disclosed in each asset’s offering page</li>
            <li>Summarized in user dashboards before transaction execution</li>
            <li>Auditable through on-chain records and financial reports</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Investors and issuers receive net-of-fee summaries at every key point: investment, income distribution, and exit.</p>

        <h3>D. Revenue Sharing (Future Governance Model)</h3>
        <p>Once Penthian’s governance token is launched (subject to licensing clarity), a portion of platform revenue may be distributed to governance participants as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Staking rewards</li>
            <li>Ecosystem grants</li>
            <li>Token buybacks</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This structure will align the platform’s success with the incentives of its most committed users.</p>
        <p>Through a diversified, transaction-linked, and transparent fee model, Penthian can generate sustainable cash flow while empowering users — not extracting from them. Our goal is to align every dollar earned with value delivered and integrity upheld.</p>

        <h2>17. Marketing & Expansion Strategy</h2>
        <p>Penthian is building more than a platform — we are establishing a global brand for borderless ownership.
