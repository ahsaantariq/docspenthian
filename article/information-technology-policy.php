        <li>Tested in sandbox/testnet environments before deployment</li>
        <li>Managed via multi-signature wallets or time-locked governance mechanisms</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3.4 Token Standards Used</h3>
    <p>Penthian supports multiple token standards based on asset type:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>ERC-3643:</strong> For identity-verified permissioned tokens, especially for securities and jurisdictionally sensitive real estate assets.</li>
        <li><strong>ERC-1155:</strong> For fractional real estate offerings and token bundling (e.g., multiple units).</li>
        <li><strong>ERC-20 (where needed):</strong> For SME ownership tokens or utility integrations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All tokens are governed by transfer restrictions, permission registries, and on-chain compliance logic.</p>

    <h3>3.5 Data Storage & Backup</h3>
    <p>Penthian follows a cloud-first, encrypted storage model:</p>

    </ul>

    <h3>3.6 Dev/Test/Production Environments</h3>
    <p>The development lifecycle is segmented into:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Development Environment:</strong> Isolated from production, with dummy/testnet tokens</li>
        <li><strong>Testing/Staging Environment:</strong> Mirrors production environment for QA and audit prep</li>
        <li><strong>Production Environment:</strong> Restricted to verified deployments only; subject to 24/7 monitoring and multi-factor access</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Code must pass through unit tests, static analysis, and peer review before being deployed to production.</p>

    <h2>4. Access Control & Authentication</h2>
    <p>Effective access control is essential to safeguarding the integrity of Penthian’s systems, data, and assets. This section outlines how we manage user and admin access, authenticate identities, and enforce the principle of least privilege.</p>

    <h3>4.1 Access Control Principles</h3>
    <p>Penthian’s access control framework is based on the following principles:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):</strong> Users and staff are granted system access based strictly on their job functions or responsibilities.</li>
        <li><strong>Least Privilege:</strong> No user is given more access than necessary to perform their task.</li>
        <li><strong>Separation of Duties:</strong> Critical operations (e.g., deploying contracts, transferring tokens, issuing refunds) require approval or involvement from multiple roles.</li>
        <li><strong>Auditability:</strong> All access attempts and changes are logged and reviewed periodically.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4.2 Authentication Methods</h3>
    <p>Penthian employs multi-factor authentication (MFA) and secure credentials for all system access:</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>User Type</th>
            <th>Authentication Method</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Platform Admins</td>
            <td>Email + Password + TOTP-based MFA</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Developers</td>
            <td>GitHub/GitLab + SSH Keys + 2FA</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Users (Investors/Issuers)</td>
            <td>Email + Password + Device-Based OTP</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>API Access</td>
            <td>Token-based access with expiration/rotation</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h3>4.3 Wallet Whitelisting & ERC-3643 Integration</h3>
    <p>As part of identity compliance:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Wallets are whitelisted after successful KYC/KYB via Veriff.</li>
        <li>Smart contracts enforce token transfer restrictions based on identity and region.</li>
        <li>Revoked, blacklisted, or non-compliant wallets are automatically disabled.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This ensures that only verified, permissioned participants can interact with sensitive tokens.</p>

    <h3>4.4 Admin Access Management</h3>
    <p>All administrative access:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Is granted only by the CTO or Compliance Officer</li>
        <li>Requires signed NDA and policy acknowledgment</li>
        <li>Is provisioned via secure infrastructure tools (e.g., IAM, RBAC systems)</li>
        <li>Includes logging and alerting on every login, role change, or configuration update</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Admin access is reviewed quarterly and revoked immediately upon role termination.</p>

    <h3>4.5 Password & Credential Policies</h3>
    <p>Penthian enforces the following policies:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Minimum password length: 12 characters</li>
        <li>Passwords must include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols</li>
        <li>Passwords must be changed every 90 days</li>
        <li>Reuse of the last 5 passwords is not permitted</li>
        <li>All stored passwords are hashed using bcrypt or equivalent</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Staff and users are encouraged to use password managers to store credentials securely.</p>

    <h3>4.6 Session Management</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>User sessions expire after 15 minutes of inactivity</li>
        <li>Admin sessions expire after 5 minutes of inactivity</li>
        <li>Login attempts are limited to 5 failures before temporary lockout</li>
        <li>Session tokens are invalidated upon logout or IP/location change</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4.7 Access Reviews & Monitoring</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Quarterly audits of user and admin access</li>
        <li>Daily monitoring of login logs, access attempts, and admin actions</li>
