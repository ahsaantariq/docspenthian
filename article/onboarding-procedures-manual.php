    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>2. Onboarding Workflow Overview</h2>
        <p>Penthian’s onboarding process is a multi-step, risk-based workflow that ensures all clients are properly identified, verified, and approved before accessing the platform. This workflow is designed for both individuals (retail) and entities (institutional) and is powered by integrated systems and human review.</p>
        <h3>2.1 Core Workflow Steps</h3>
        <p>The onboarding process involves the following key steps:</p>
        <p><strong>Step 1: Account Creation</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>User provides email and password or connects via social login (where applicable).</li>
            <li>A verification link or code is sent to confirm contact information.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Step 2: KYC/KYB Information Collection</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Powered by Veriff integration.</li>
            <li><strong>Retail Clients provide:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Full legal name</li>
                    <li>Government-issued ID</li>
                    <li>Selfie and liveness check</li>
                    <li>Proof of address (e.g. utility bill, bank statement)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Institutional Clients provide:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Company incorporation documents</li>
                    <li>UBO identification and verification</li>
                    <li>Board resolution or proof of authority</li>
                    <li>Business address and tax number</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Step 3: Screening & Risk Scoring</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Automated checks against global watchlists, sanctions databases (UN, OFAC, EU, etc.).</li>
            <li>PEP (Politically Exposed Person) screening.</li>
            <li>AML risk profiling based on jurisdiction, source of funds, and user activity expectations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Step 4: Approval or Escalation</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Low- to medium-risk clients are automatically approved upon successful checks.</li>
            <li>High-risk or flagged clients are escalated to the Compliance team for manual review.</li>
            <li>Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) is applied where required.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Step 5: Wallet Setup & Token Access</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Upon approval, the user receives access to their wallet (non-custodial or platform-based).</li>
            <li>A unique ERC-3643-compliant identity token is assigned to the wallet.</li>
            <li>User can now buy, trade, and hold tokenized assets within legal limits.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>2.2 Smart Contract Onboarding Integration</h3>
        <p>Penthian’s onboarding process includes smart contract-based enforcement of access control:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>ERC-3643 identity tokens verify KYC status on-chain.</li>
            <li>Only wallets with valid identity tokens can interact with tokenized assets.</li>
            <li>Revocation of identity tokens disables platform access if KYC/KYB expires or is invalidated.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>2.3 Multi-Jurisdictional Flow</h3>
        <p>Depending on the client’s jurisdiction, additional steps may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Geo-IP blocks for restricted or high-risk jurisdictions</li>
            <li>Request for tax residency certification (e.g., W-8BEN, W-9)</li>
            <li>Localized consent forms or disclosures where required by law</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>2.4 Onboarding SLAs</h3>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Onboarding Type</th>
                <th>Expected Completion Time</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Standard Retail Client</td>
                <td>&lt; 10 minutes</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Medium-Risk Retail</td>
                <td>&lt; 24 hours</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Institutional Client</td>
                <td>24–72 hours</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Escalated High-Risk Case</td>
                <td>2–5 business days</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>These timeframes are monitored and optimized via internal dashboards and monthly compliance reports.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>3. Client Risk Profiling</h2>
        <p>Risk-based client profiling enables Penthian to apply appropriate levels of due diligence, monitoring, and controls to each client. This aligns with AML/CFT obligations and helps protect the platform from exposure to money laundering, fraud, and reputational risk.</p>
        <h3>3.1 Risk Categories</h3>
        <p>Penthian classifies clients into three main risk levels:</p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Risk Level</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Low Risk</td>
                <td>Clients from low-risk jurisdictions, with standard ID, low volume activity, no red flags</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Medium Risk</td>
                <td>Clients with moderate volume, high-risk industry exposure, or partial documentation mismatches</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>High Risk</td>
                <td>PEPs, clients from high-risk jurisdictions, large volume investors, or entities with unclear ownership structure</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <h3>3.2 Risk Factors Considered</h3>
        <p>Risk profiles are based on a combination of static and dynamic factors:</p>
        <p><strong>Static Factors</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Jurisdiction of residence or incorporation</li>
            <li>Type of client (retail vs. institutional)</li>
            <li>Nature of business (for entities)</li>
            <li>Source of funds (declared and verified)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Dynamic Factors</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Trading volume and frequency</li>
            <li>Token types purchased or listed</li>
            <li>Interaction with wallets or addresses flagged by Chainalysis or equivalent</li>
            <li>Past incidents or internal flags</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>3.3 Risk Scoring Methodology</h3>
        <p>Each factor is assigned a numeric score (1–5). The aggregate score places the client into one of the three risk categories. Profiles are updated dynamically if:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Activity significantly changes (e.g., sudden increase in volume)</li>
            <li>New intelligence or sanctions list entries emerge</li>
            <li>A client’s behavior violates platform policies</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>3.4 Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD)</h3>
        <p>High-risk clients undergo additional checks, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Video verification</li>
            <li>Proof of source of wealth</li>
            <li>Ongoing monitoring for adverse media</li>
            <li>Manual review of onboarding documents</li>
            <li>Board-level signoff for institutional clients</li>
        </ul>
        <p>EDD is documented in the compliance portal and reviewed quarterly.</p>
        <h3>3.5 Periodic Review of Profiles</h3>
        <p>All client profiles are reviewed as follows:</p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Risk Level</th>
                <th>Review Frequency</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Low</td>
                <td>Every 12 months</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Medium</td>
                <td>Every 6 months</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>High</td>
                <td>Every 3 months or as triggered by alerts</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>Triggers may include large single transactions, rapid KYC reattempts, or jurisdiction changes.</p>
        <h3>3.6 Risk Mitigation Actions</h3>
        <p>Based on profile, the following measures may apply:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Transaction limits or withdrawal cooldowns</li>
            <li>Smart contract restrictions on access to specific tokens</li>
            <li>Holding periods for secondary sales</li>
            <li>Manual approval of off-platform withdrawals</li>
            <li>Suspension or termination of account (subject to review)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>4. Client Acceptance & Rejection Criteria</h2>

        <h2>5. Identity Verification (KYC/KYB) Procedures</h2>
        <p>Identity verification is central to Penthian’s onboarding process. All clients — individuals and entities — must undergo robust Know Your Customer (KYC) or Know Your Business (KYB) checks before being approved to access the platform or transact in virtual assets. These procedures are performed in partnership with Veriff, our KYC provider, and aligned with FSC regulatory obligations and global AML/CFT standards.</p>

        <h2>6. Source of Funds & Wealth Verification</h2>
        <p>To ensure the legitimacy of all capital entering the Penthian platform, the source of funds and, where required, the source of wealth must be verified for all clients whose risk profile, transaction volume, or jurisdiction triggers Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD).

        <h2>7. Wallet & Smart Contract Access Controls</h2>
        <p>Penthian integrates identity verification with blockchain-based access control, ensuring that only verified users can interact with tokenized assets. This section outlines how wallets are authorized, how identity tokens work, and how access is enforced via smart contracts.</p>
        <h3>7.1 Wallet Types Supported</h3>
        <p>Penthian supports two types of user wallets:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Self-custody wallets (e.g., MetaMask, WalletConnect, Ledger)</li>
            <li>Platform-managed wallets (custodial or semi-custodial, subject to jurisdiction and user choice)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All wallets must complete KYC/KYB and pass compliance checks before being activated.</p>
        <h3>7.2 ERC-3643 Identity Token Integration</h3>
        <p>To enforce access control on-chain, Penthian issues identity tokens based on the ERC-3643 standard:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Each verified wallet is assigned an ERC-3643-compliant token</li>
            <li>This token acts as a compliance passport, allowing interaction with whitelisted assets</li>
            <li>Revocation of the identity token disables smart contract access</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These tokens are non-transferable and stored in the user's wallet alongside asset tokens.</p>
        <h3>7.3 Access Control Mechanism</h3>
        <p>Smart contracts deployed by Penthian include logic that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Checks for a valid ERC-3643 identity token before allowing purchase, transfer, or listing of any asset</li>
            <li>Blocks access from non-compliant or expired wallets</li>
            <li>Tracks interactions to detect unusual or risky behavior</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>7.4 Multi-Wallet Support & Identity Mapping</h3>
        <p>Clients can link multiple wallets to a single verified identity if approved by compliance. Each wallet:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Is verified individually</li>
            <li>Has its own identity token</li>
            <li>Can be suspended independently if risk is detected</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Mapping is stored off-chain with encrypted references for internal tracking.</p>
        <h3>7.5 Lost Access or Wallet Recovery</h3>
        <p>In the event of a lost wallet:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Clients must undergo re-verification</li>
            <li>A new wallet can be linked and assigned an updated identity token</li>
            <li>Tokenized assets may be reissued or migrated under legal supervision and internal policy (requires documented proof of loss and board-level approval for high-value assets)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>7.6 Suspicious Wallet Activity</h3>
        <p>Wallets may be temporarily frozen or blacklisted if:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Transactions breach thresholds without justification</li>
            <li>Wallet interacts with flagged or darkweb-associated addresses</li>
            <li>Smart contract usage shows signs of automation, front-running, or bot behavior</li>
            <li>Access is attempted from geo-blocked IPs or Tor networks</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>7.7 Jurisdiction-Based Restrictions</h3>
        <p>Smart contracts and frontend APIs include geo-IP and on-chain restriction layers. Users from the following may be blocked or limited:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>OFAC-sanctioned regions</li>
            <li>FATF high-risk jurisdictions</li>
            <li>Countries where tokenized asset trading is illegal or restricted</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>8. Ongoing Monitoring & Reverification</h2>
        <p>Onboarding is not a one-time event. Continuous monitoring ensures that all clients remain compliant over time and that changes in behavior, risk profile, or jurisdiction are identified and addressed early. This protects both investors and the platform from emerging threats or regulatory violations.</p>
        <h3>8.1 Monitoring Tools</h3>
        <p>Penthian uses automated and manual systems to monitor:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Transaction patterns (volume, frequency, counterparty analysis)</li>
            <li>Jurisdictional access (IP logging, VPN/Tor detection)</li>
            <li>Smart contract interactions (token trades, wallet-to-wallet transfers)</li>
            <li>Behavior changes (sudden shifts in asset type or activity levels)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Tools used include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Veriff ongoing screening</li>
            <li>Blockchain analytics (e.g., Chainalysis or equivalent)</li>
            <li>Internal compliance dashboard (flagging triggers for human review)</li>
        </ul>

        </table>
        <p>Reverification requires updated proof of ID, address, and source of funds where applicable.</p>
        <h3>8.4 User Notifications</h3>
        <p>Users are notified via email and/or in-platform notifications when reverification is due. If not completed within 14 days:</p>
