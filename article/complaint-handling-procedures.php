    <h3>5.1 Complaint Handling Team</h3>
    <p>The complaint management structure includes the following key personnel:</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Role</th>
            <th>Responsibilities</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Customer Support Team</td>
            <td>Initial receipt, acknowledgment, and categorization of complaints</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Complaints Officer</td>
            <td>Coordinates investigations, communicates outcomes to clients, and ensures compliance</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Compliance Officer</td>
            <td>Oversees regulatory adherence, escalates high-risk complaints, and reports to FSC</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

            <td>Investigate specific aspects of complaints related to their domain</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Complaints Committee (if applicable)</td>
            <td>Reviews high-severity complaints involving large financial impact, legal threats, or regulatory risk</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h3>5.2 Escalation Protocol</h3>
    <p>Complaints may be escalated internally if:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The issue is unresolved after initial investigation</li>
        <li>The client is dissatisfied with the resolution</li>
        <li>The complaint involves a regulatory breach or high-value transaction</li>
        <li>There is a potential risk of reputational damage or systemic failure</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Escalations go from the Support Team → Complaints Officer → Compliance Officer → Complaints Committee.</p>

    <h3>5.3 Independence & Impartiality</h3>
    <p>To ensure objectivity:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Staff who are the subject of a complaint may not participate in its investigation</li>
        <li>The Complaints Officer must act independently of sales, marketing, or revenue-related functions</li>
        <li>Clients are treated fairly, without discrimination or bias, regardless of the nature of their complaint</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5.4 Complaint Register</h3>
    <p>A centralized Complaint Register is maintained by the Compliance Officer, tracking:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Complaint ID and timestamps</li>
        <li>Complainant identity (where known)</li>
        <li>Issue summary and category</li>
        <li>Actions taken and personnel involved</li>
        <li>Outcome and client feedback</li>
        <li>Date of closure</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This register is reviewed quarterly by senior management and is available for FSC audit.</p>

    <h3>5.5 Training & Oversight</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>All staff receive annual training on complaint handling procedures, including escalation and documentation.</li>
        <li>The effectiveness of the complaint process is evaluated during internal audits.</li>
        <li>Regular feedback loops help refine procedures based on trends in complaints.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. External Dispute Resolution & FSC Reporting</h2>
    <p>In cases where internal resolution is not satisfactory or where a complaint involves regulatory implications, clients have the right to escalate their concerns to an external authority. Penthian Ltd is committed to facilitating access to independent resolution mechanisms and cooperating fully with the Financial Services Commission (FSC) of Mauritius.</p>

    <h3>6.1 Right to Escalate</h3>
    <p>If a client is dissatisfied with the final outcome or the handling of a complaint, they may escalate the matter to the FSC or an independent dispute resolution body.</p>
    <p>Details of the client’s right to escalate will be clearly stated in the final complaint outcome letter.</p>

    <h3>6.2 FSC Contact Information</h3>
    <p>Clients may file a formal complaint with the Financial Services Commission using the following contact details:</p>
    <p>Financial Services Commission (FSC) – Mauritius<br>
    FSC House, 54 Cybercity, Ebene 72201, Mauritius<br>
    📞 Tel: +230 403 7000<br>
    📧 Email: fscmauritius@intnet.mu<br>
    🌐 Website: www.fscmauritius.org</p>

    <h3>6.3 Conditions for External Filing</h3>
    <p>Clients must generally attempt resolution with Penthian first, unless the issue:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Involves serious fraud or immediate legal breach</li>
        <li>Poses systemic or market-wide risk</li>
        <li>Has already been independently investigated and closed internally</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>6.4 FSC Reporting by Penthian</h3>
    <p>As part of its regulatory obligations, Penthian Ltd will:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Report all unresolved complaints involving potential breaches of law, AML/CFT concerns, or investor harm to the FSC within 5 business days</li>
        <li>Submit quarterly summaries of total complaints, their nature, resolution time, and trends</li>
        <li>Cooperate fully with FSC investigations or audits relating to specific complaints</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>6.5 Retaliation-Free Policy</h3>
    <p>Clients are protected from any form of retaliation or disadvantage for submitting a complaint or escalating to the FSC.</p>

    <h2>7. Recordkeeping & Confidentiality</h2>
    <p>Maintaining detailed and secure records of all complaints is essential to demonstrate transparency, support future audits, and comply with FSC and AML/CFT regulations. At the same time, client confidentiality must be preserved in all stages of the complaint lifecycle.</p>

    </ul>

    <h3>7.2 Storage & Access Control</h3>
